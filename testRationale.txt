I tested my extensions from Part 1 with the file CopyTests.json, and my extensions from Part 2 with the file LoginTests.json. Each line in these files corresponds to one command (test). The corresponding .json_output file lists the expected output that a correct system should produce for each line in the .json test file.

Part 1 tests:
I tested my copy operation by creating three keys and testing the behavior of incorrect and correct client requests. First, I checked possible errors in a copy operation. If a src_key or dst_key is provided in the client request but does not exist in the kvstore, or if a client request contains only one src_key and dst_key and not the other, then the server should respond with a FAIL status. I verify after any FAIL status that the key-value pairs in the server have not been changed. Then, I test that a valid client request changes the key-value pair in the server and that the server responds with an OK status. Finally, I tested that a copy operation also FAILs if a key that used to exist but is deleted also cannot be copied after the fact.

Part 2 tests:
I tested my login operation and logout operation in tandem. First I check that my login operation responds as expected. After I log in, any operations following should include the uid, and operate as intended (meaning they fail and succeed). If the client attempts a second login operation before they logout, the server should respond with a FAIL status and not include the uid. I then tested my logout operation, and verify that operations following the logout do not include the uid. I login once again with a different uid, to ensure it changes with each login.
